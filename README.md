Front-EndHomework

Hi.
This is my result.

I made most of the points.

I made the one point of extracredit a light-box form with validations, ( email, telphone) with javascript.
when the text is incorrect, the input box, turns border red, other wise it would be default color.

from the mobile points, I used  @media to change de view content.  

I hope what I did is right :)!!
